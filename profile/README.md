Decoding ML is a newsletter that approaches ML production use cases using good SWE and MLOps practices.

> Our motto is "More engineering, less F1 scores."

By subscribing to Decoding ML, you will learn how to build end-to-end ML systems.

Decoding ML is the hub for continuous learning on:

- ML system design
- ML engineering
- MLOps

*We are all about designing, coding, deploying, and monitoring awesome ML use cases that can directly be applied in the real world — no stories — just hands-on content.*

## Why follow?

Join Decoding ML for battle-tested content on designing, coding, and deploying production-grade ML & MLOps systems.

> No more bedtime stories in Jupyter Notebooks.

→ *Decoding ML is all about hands-on advice from our 10+ years of experience.*
