[Decoding ML](https://decodingml.substack.com/) creates battle-tested content on building production-grade ML systems leveraging good SWE and MLOps practices. 

> Our motto is "More engineering, less F1 scores."

*Following Decoding ML, you will learn about the entire lifecycle of an ML system, from system design to deploying and monitoring.*

Decoding ML is the hub for continuous learning on:

- ML system design
- ML engineering
- MLOps
- Large language models
- Computer vision

**We are all about end-to-end ML use cases that can directly be applied in the real world — no stories — just hands-on content.**

## Why follow?

Join [Decoding ML](https://decodingml.substack.com/) for battle-tested content on designing, coding, and deploying production-grade ML & MLOps systems. *Every week.* For FREE.

> No more bedtime stories in Jupyter Notebooks.

→ *DML is all about hands-on advice from our 10+ years of experience in AI.*
